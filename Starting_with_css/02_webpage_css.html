    <h1 style="color: red;">About CSS</h1>
    <p style="background-color: yellow;color: red;">CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology that plays a pivotal role in web development. It serves as the design and layout language of the World Wide Web, enabling developers to control the appearance and presentation of web pages. CSS works hand in hand with HTML, the markup language used to structure content on the web. By defining rules and styles, CSS allows developers to specify how elements should be displayed, including aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. Its "cascading" nature means that styles can be applied hierarchically, with the most specific rules taking precedence. This flexibility and separation of content and design make CSS an indispensable tool for creating visually appealing and responsive websites across different devices and screen sizes, contributing to a seamless and enjoyable web browsing experience. It also contributes to cross-browser compatibility, performance optimization, and web accessibility, making it an indispensable tool for crafting visually appealing and user-friendly websites in the modern digital landscape.</p>
